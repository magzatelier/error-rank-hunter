        <p>The Seoul Hunter Recruitment Fair was, in a word, loud.</p>

        <p>Not just in volume, though the noise was considerable, but in everything. Hundreds of voices competing with promotional videos and the occasional burst of skill demonstrations from overeager recruiters. The colors. The banners. The desperation hanging in the air like cheap cologne.</p>

        <p>Lee Jihoon clutched his registration badge and tried not to look as lost as he felt.</p>

        <p><em>D-rank</em>, the badge announced in blue lettering. As if anyone needed to see it to know. The big guilds had a sixth sense for it. He'd barely approached the Titan Guild booth before the recruiter's eyes had flicked to his badge, then past him, already scanning for someone more worth their time.</p>

        <p>"We're primarily recruiting B-ranks and above," she'd said. Not unkindly. That was almost worse.</p>

        <p>Three hours in and Jihoon had collected exactly zero real prospects and one promotional pen from a guild.</p>

        <p>Around him, the fair churned on. A C-rank hunter he'd gone to high school with — Yejun, who'd awakened six months before him and never let him forget it — was currently being courted by two mid-tier guilds at once, playing them off each other with the ease of someone who'd never had to worry about being wanted.</p>

        <p>Jihoon's mother had cried when he awakened. <span class="thought">Finally,</span> she'd said, <span class="thought">finally something is going right for you.</span></p>

        <p>He hadn't had the heart to tell her that D-rank wasn't exactly a golden ticket. That awakening didn't automatically fix the two years of failed job interviews and the degree that hadn't led anywhere and the growing pile of bills that—</p>

        <p>He needed air.</p>

        <p>Not real air — the convention center's ventilation was working fine — but space. Distance. A moment where he wasn't being assessed and found wanting.</p>

        <p>Jihoon slipped away from the main thoroughfare, past the big booths with their holographic displays and their confident slogans (<em>RISE WITH PHOENIX</em>, <em>STRENGTH IN UNITY</em>, <em>TITAN: WHERE LEGENDS ARE MADE</em>), into the quieter edges of the hall where the crowds thinned and the lights weren't quite as bright.</p>

        <p>He found a wall and leaned against it, closing his eyes.</p>

        <p>Twenty-four years old. D-rank hunter. No guild, no prospects, no plan.</p>

        <p><span class="thought">It's fine,</span> he told himself. <span class="thought">It's the first fair. There will be others. Something will work out. Something has to—</span></p>

        <p>"Overwhelming, isn't it?"</p>

        <div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

        <p>Jihoon's eyes snapped open.</p>

        <p>There was a man standing a few feet away, leaning against a booth that Jihoon somehow hadn't noticed. Which was strange, because the man was…</p>

        <p>…the man was…</p>

        <p><em>Beautiful</em> felt like the wrong word. Too soft. This was something sharper, more deliberate. A face that looked like it had been designed to make people forget what they were saying mid-sentence. Dark hair, dark eyes, features arranged with an elegance that seemed almost unfair.</p>

        <p>He was smiling, just slightly. Sympathetic.</p>

        <p>"First fair?" the man asked.</p>

        <p>Jihoon realized he was staring. He also realized he hadn't answered. "I— yes. How did you know?"</p>

        <p>"You have the look." The man pushed off from his booth — it was a modest setup, Jihoon noticed now, tasteful but understated, no screaming banners or flashing lights — and took a step closer. Not aggressive. Friendly. Like an older brother who'd spotted you struggling at a family gathering. "The 'I've been rejected six times and I'm questioning all my life choices' look. I've seen it before."</p>

        <p>"It was only four times," Jihoon muttered, then winced. "That's not better, is it."</p>

        <p>The man laughed. It was a warm sound. "It's not about the number. It's about the system. These big guilds," he gestured vaguely toward the main floor, "they're not looking for potential. They're looking for finished products. Someone they can slot in immediately. It's efficient for them, but it doesn't leave much room for people who just need a chance to grow."</p>

        <p>Something in Jihoon's chest loosened.</p>

        <p>"I'm guessing you're D-rank?" the man continued. At Jihoon's nod, his smile turned knowing. "D-rank is a tough spot. Too high for the desperate guilds to lowball you, too low for the big ones to take seriously. But it's a good rank. Room for development. The right environment makes all the difference."</p>

        <p>"That's... actually really reassuring to hear."</p>

        <p>"It's the truth." The man spread his hands. "Look, I'm not going to pitch you some fantasy. I'm not Titan or Phoenix. We're a smaller guild. But we value our hunters. Good commission rates, flexible scheduling, and we actually invest in training. Most importantly—" he leaned in slightly, conspiratorial, "—we don't treat D-ranks like they're disposable."</p>

        <p>Jihoon felt his heart rate pick up. This was... this was actually happening. Someone was interested. Someone who seemed genuine and wasn't looking at him like he was a waste of time.</p>

        <p>"That sounds," he said carefully, "almost too good to be true."</p>

        <p>"Doesn't it?" The man's smile was self-deprecating now, charming. "I promise there's a catch. There's always a catch. In our case, we're small. You won't get the prestige of a big guild name. But if what you want is a place to actually develop as a hunter, to be supported instead of thrown to the wolves..." He shrugged. "Well. I'm biased, but I think we're worth considering."</p>

        <p>"I'm definitely considering," Jihoon said, and meant it. "What's the—"</p>

        <p>A hand clamped onto his arm.</p>

        <p>"Jihoon-ah!"</p>

        <p>He turned to find Minjae — a friend since middle school, E-rank, still jobless but at least here for moral support — gripping his elbow with an intensity that seemed wildly disproportionate to the situation. His eyes were slightly wild.</p>

        <p>"Minjae? What—"</p>

        <p>Minjae leaned in close. His lips moved, barely a whisper, shaping a word:</p>

        <p><em>Vanguard.</em></p>

        <p>Jihoon's brain stuttered.</p>

        <p>He looked back at the man. At the booth behind him — tasteful, understated, conspicuously missing a name banner.</p>

        <p>The face. That face. He'd seen it before. Not in person, but on forums, in articles, attached to headlines he'd scrolled past with secondhand embarrassment.</p>

        <p><em>World's Only E/— Rank Hunter.</em></p>

        <p>Yoon Hajin.</p>

        <p>The man — Hajin — was still smiling, but something in his expression had shifted. Just slightly. A flicker of something that might have been resignation, there and gone.</p>

        <p>"I," Jihoon said. His voice came out strangled. "I just remembered I have to— my mom is calling. I have to take— sorry, I'm sorry, I have to—"</p>

        <p>He didn't finish the sentence. He was already walking, Minjae's hand still on his arm, pulling him back toward the crowds, the noise, the safety of the main floor.</p>

        <p>He didn't look back.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

        <p>The moment the kid was gone — practically running, which was a new record for fastest exit, actually — Hajin let the smile drop.</p>

        <p><span class="thought">Tsk.</span></p>

        <p><span class="thought">Almost had that one.</span></p>

        <p>He straightened the pamphlets no one had taken.</p>
