              <li>Monthly salary vs. commission split — know what you're agreeing to</li>
              <li>Death benefit policy — morbid but necessary</li>
              <li>Training support — some guilds invest in growth, others just want bodies</li>

        <h1>Vanguard Guild Receives Sixth Association Warning After Unauthorized Dungeon Entry</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">Hunter Daily | Thursday</p>
        <p>The Hunter Association issued its sixth official warning to Vanguard Guild on Thursday after guild master Yoon Hajin (25) was found to have entered a C-rank dungeon without proper clearance.</p>
        <p>According to Association records, Yoon currently holds an E-rank classification, though his status has been noted as "unstable" due to irregular mana readings. Under current regulations, hunters ranked E or below are prohibited from entering dungeons above E-rank without supervision from a hunter ranked B or above.</p>
        <p>Yoon reportedly entered the Mapo District dungeon alone after civilian hikers were spotted near the entrance. He was later extracted by the Korea Rescue Unit after sustaining injuries. The civilians had already evacuated on their own.</p>
        <p>"The dungeon destabilized shortly after entry," an Association spokesperson stated. "Fortunately there were no casualties."</p>
        <p>This marks Vanguard's sixth warning in four years. Three more warnings within a twelve-month period will result in mandatory guild dissolution review.</p>
        <p>Vanguard, founded in 2019, was once considered one of Korea's most promising guilds. Yoon and co-founder Kang Sunwoo both initially registered as SS-rank hunters—the only double-SS guild in the country at the time. However, following the 2019 Gwanak Mountain disaster in which fourteen hunters died, Yoon's rank was reevaluated and recorded as E-rank with inconsistent readings. Kang departed shortly after to establish Asura Guild, now ranked as Korea's top guild.</p>
        <p>Yoon could not be reached for comment. Vanguard currently has three registered members.</p>

      'Daily Hunter - Shopping Photos': `
        <h1>Yoon Hajin Photographed Shopping at Luxury Cheongdam Store</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">Daily Hunter | Wednesday</p>
        <p>Vanguard Guild Master Yoon Hajin (25) was spotted at a high-end department store in Cheongdam on Wednesday afternoon, sparking renewed criticism about his spending habits.</p>
        <p>Photos show Yoon exiting the store with multiple shopping bags. Sources say he spent approximately 4 hours inside.</p>
        <p>"He comes in regularly," an anonymous store employee said. "Always very polite. Tips well."</p>
        <p>Online commenters were quick to criticize. "While real hunters risk their lives, he's shopping," wrote one user. "The Yoon family money won't last forever."</p>
        <p>Yoon inherited an estimated ₩82 billion following his parents' death in 2017. Financial experts have speculated that his guild operations, which have produced minimal income over four years, have significantly reduced this amount.</p>
        <p>Vanguard has not completed a successful dungeon raid in eleven months.</p>

      'Hunter Weekly - Gwanak Memorial': `
        <h1>Memorial Held for Gwanak Mountain Disaster Victims</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">Hunter Weekly | Saturday</p>
        <p>Families and fellow hunters gathered at Gwanak Mountain Memorial Park on Saturday to mark the seventh anniversary of the deadliest joint guild operation in Korean history.</p>
        <p>Fourteen hunters lost their lives on September 15th, 2019, when an A-rank dungeon unexpectedly escalated during a routine clearing operation. Four guilds participated in the joint raid. Only one guild master emerged uninjured.</p>
        <p>"My son was twenty-three years old," said Park Eunji, mother of victim Park Donghyun. "He believed in his guild master. He trusted him."</p>
        <p>The memorial now includes a stone wall engraved with the names of the fallen. Fresh flowers are placed there daily.</p>
        <p>Kang Sunwoo, then vice guild master of Vanguard and now leader of Asura Guild, attended the ceremony and laid flowers. He did not speak publicly.</p>
        <p>Vanguard Guild Master Yoon Hajin was not present. He has not attended any memorial events since the first anniversary, when protesters demanded his removal.</p>
        <p>Following the disaster, an Association inquiry found "inconclusive evidence of misconduct" but noted "critical failures in leadership and judgment." Yoon's rank was reevaluated from SS to E-rank with unstable readings, a result that remains unexplained.</p>
        <p>The inquiry's full findings remain sealed at the request of multiple parties.</p>
        <p>"We still don't have answers," Park said. "We deserve answers."</p>
